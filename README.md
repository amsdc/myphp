The Flask package consists of 11 applications, as listed below:

1. `admin` - Displays the Administration dashboard.
2. `announcements` - Part of original codebase of DAV website. Not relevant.
3. `api` - Not relevant.

6. `main` - Displays homepage.
7. `profile` - Allows to edit user metadata.
8. `questions` - Not relevant. 
9. `setup` - GUI Setup for MyPHP. Does not do any extra setup for Water Conservation.
10. `user_management` - The name is self-explanatory.
11. `water_conservation` - The core of this application. Deals with filling of form and leaderboard.
