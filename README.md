# My Personal Home Page

MyPHP will serve as a admin panel template. Use it freely.


The Flask package consists of 11 applications, as listed below:

1. `admin` - Displays the Administration dashboard.
3. `api` - Not relevant.
4. `auth` - Authentication application. Deals with all authentication and authorization aspects.
5. `errors` - Deals with the display of error pages.
6. `main` - Displays homepage.
7. `profile` - Allows to edit user metadata.
9. `setup` - GUI Setup for MyPHP. 
10. `user_management` - The name is self-explanatory.
